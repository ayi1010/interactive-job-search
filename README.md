<h1>Interactive Job Search Application</h1>

<h3>Ongoing project [![30%]](https://progress-bar.dev/30)</h3>
 This is an interactive job search application for programming jobs around Australia. 

 You can see my progress on my [blog page.](https://www.sohwakhaeng.com/posts/going-all-the-way/) 


 
This application utilise many components/classes from the [Bootstrap Library.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

You can see the website by clicking [here.](https://ayi1010.github.io/jwd-final-project/)

<h3>Wireframe</h3>

Wireframes were created in [Figma](https://figma.com) to illustrate what the task manager could look like.
Wireframes for both a mobile and desktop version were created to ensure the application is mobile responsive.

  <img src="./img/wireframeDesktop.png" height="300" title="desktop-wireframe" alt="desktop-wireframe">
</p>

<h3>Design Principles</h3>
The design concept was to go with something that was minimalistic, clean and simple. The focus was on functionality and ease of use for the user.
The colour pallet was also simple with prominent colours used only in call to action areas.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
